# Data Visualisation Project for the module DAO3702

This project focuses on using Rshiny to create an app to visualise data from the US traffic accident dataset to create insights to identify certain areas that the county can use to improve their road facilities. 

Note that this project was done in Spring 2020. Therefore, the data we have gotten from the Kaggle website has been updated to the 2020 version. Although we do not forsee any changes that would affect our project, but I have uploaded the 2019 version of the data to this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RFrn6NHNZKBdAVgrqPO80xL3AyCX3Gfx/view?usp=sharing)

More details about the project can be found in the HTML file. 

### How to run.

1) Download the dataset from the website. 
2) Download PublicholidayCA.xlsx, estimatedData.csv and run the cleandata.R to obtain the cleaned datasets. 
Note that you can adjust the county that you want the data from in the cleandata.R file.
3) Download the app.R.
4) Update the Google API key in the app.R code. You can learn how to do so [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key?authuser=3)
5) Install all required packages and let the code run :)
